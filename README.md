# PMTF-Project

Unofficial PocketMine fork. More advanced than most forks. We are much better.

Officially mantained from @AryToNeX and @fycarman.

## What is PMTF Project?

PMTF Project is *the most potent and full-featured* PocketMine-MP fork that you can find on internet!

It is different from other forks because we are mostly concentrated in bug fixing and we want to implement fully working features which don't crash your server every 5 minutes.

## Advantages

In what this fork is more powerful that PocketMine-MP and other forks?

* Compatible with MC:PE 0.13.0 and above (we must try this with 0.14.0 :D )
* It has many many fixes that official PocketMine-MP does not have.
* It has a few original implementations
* IT IS CONSTANTLY DEVELOPED!

In particular, we have:

* hasPermission() on null **fixed**
* Working 0.13.0 skins (with transparency)
* Fully working hunger

We are working in:

* New blocks!
* Golden apples!
* Potions!
* Enchantments!
* All types of doors!
* Experience!
* Redstone elements! (and we are not sure about them, so... :D )
* Brewing!
* Many other features!
