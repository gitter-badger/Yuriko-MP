## What is Yuriko-MP?

Yuriko-MP is *the most powerful and full-featured* PocketMine-MP fork that you can find on internet!

It is different from other forks because we are mostly concentrated in bug fixing and we want to implement fully working features which don't crash your server every 5 minutes.

## Advantages

In what this fork is more powerful that PocketMine-MP and other forks?

* Compatible with MC:PE 0.13.0 and above (we must try this with 0.14.0 :D )
* It has many many fixes that official PocketMine-MP does not have.
* It has a few original implementations
* IT IS CONSTANTLY DEVELOPED!

In particular, we have:

* hasPermission() on null **fixed**
* Working 0.13.0 skins (with transparency)
* Fully working hunger
* All the enchantments!
* All the potion effects!
* Golden Apples!

We are working in:

* Fix existing blocks!
* Support for not implemented blocks!
* Potions!
* Experience! (and with the experience we will put a fully working enchantment table)
* Brewing! (Only brewing mechanic for now.. We need nether and blazes for full brewing implementation)
* Redstone elements! (and we are not sure about them, so... :D )
* PHP7 support! (Not now, but later.)
* Many other features!
