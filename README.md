## What is Yuriko-MP?

Yuriko-MP wants to be *the most powerful and full-featured* PocketMine-MP fork that you can find on internet!

It is different from other forks because we are mostly concentrated in bug fixing and we want to implement fully working features which don't crash your server every 5 minutes.

## Advantages

In what this fork is more powerful that PocketMine-MP and other forks?

* Compatible with MC:PE 0.13.1
* It has many many fixes that official PocketMine-MP does not have.
* It has a few original implementations
* It is constantly developed!

## Why Creative Commons and not LGPL like other forks?

### Attribution

We want credits for this software, and with CC license we are sure that we will be credited. We are crediting other projects for their precious slices of code.

### NoCommercial

Just to be clear, we want to develop a free software but LGPL allows to redistribute or to sell software, and we don't want this. People shall not pay for Yuriko-MP, not now nor in the future.

### NoDerivatives

We don't want forks of the fork, so if you have a fix or a implementation you can fork it and submit a pull request; in this mode we can keep only one fork with all implementations/fixes. One fork, better programming.
Anyway, some servers can have different necessities than others, so you can modify Yuriko-MP but only for personal use.

If you want to modify Yuriko-MP for personal use:

* You shall not modify Yuriko-MP's name.
* You shall not modify attribution to ItalianDevs4PM.
* You shall not modify the version of Yuriko-MP.
* You must modify the codename in order to advise who does /version command that it's a modified version of Yuriko-MP.
* You must keep in mind that pull requests are accepted. :P
